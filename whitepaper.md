## Abstract

  + Token
    - 7evn is a ERC20 designed for use as a gaming token on the EthPoW network. Games in the 7evn Gaming House will accept both EthW (the native EthPoW network token) and 7evn token for gameplay with the added incentive of using 7evn for gaming by offering a discount in value vs the native token EthW. 
    - Additionally, daily rewards will be allocated to top scorers in the 20th percentile varying from cost (payed out in 7evn) of a game played, up to a grand prize (paid out in 7evn) determined by the amount of games played. Scores can be reviewed on the High Scores page. All of the winning 20th percentile contestants of the daily rewards are automatically entered into the weekly prizes draw. If the threshold is not crossed on any given day, that day does not figure in the average weekly high score. If no day resulted in the crossing of the threshold of games played, then no weekly reward pay out can be made.
  + Game Phases
    - In the initial phase, no rewards will be distributed until such time that the reward phase has begun and a threshold of games played is reached. Thereafter, only the top ten High Scores be rewarded payouts. This phase will continue until games played daily reach more than 1000. In the final phase the final implementation of rewarding the top 20th percentile will occur.
  + Scoring
    - After the 1st Phase of game development and the game is deployed, on the initial launch of games, phases of popularity must be achieved in order to cross the threshold of the daily and weekly reward payouts. Until then no payouts will be made. This threshold is typically 75 to 100 daily games. the 2nd Phase continues with no payout until the 75-100 game threshold. Thereafter, in the 3rd Phase, the Top Ten scores will be rewarded in proportionally appropriate amount with the Top Score receiving the highest Payout and the 10th receiving at least the amount paid for the game (at least cost of the game).
    - Once a game has been initiated by depositing the appropriate fee, the score will be visible. Once a game is over the score will be tallied and recorded on the server available for viewing.
    - Additionally, when daily games played crosses the next threshold of more than 1000 Phase 4 will commence and rewards will be paid out to the top 20th percentile. Grand prizes are calculated to be approximately 2,000,000 7evn if games played crosses 1000!!

  + Rewards

    - Once tallied scores are final, rewards will be payed out as soon as is feasible within an hour of the end of a day.
